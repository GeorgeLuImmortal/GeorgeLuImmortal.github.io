<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at ByteDance <img src='./images/tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a AI researcher now in Shanghai, China. 

I am now working on NLP, multi-modality, LLM-related foundational research, particular in LLM speedup, KIE and document AI. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [lujinghui@bytedance.com](mailto:lujinghuii@bytedance.com). We are hiring interns!

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Xiamen University (厦门大学)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/) and earned a Master's degree from the School of Computer Science at [University College Dublin (都柏林大学)](https://www.ucd.ie/), where I was advised by [Prof. Mark Keane](https://people.ucd.ie/mark.keane), focusing on natural language processing. Then, I completed my PhD at University College Dublin under the supervision of [Prof. Brian Mac Namee](https://people.ucd.ie/brian.macnamee), focusing on interdisciplinary methods for Deep Learning, NLP and Human-in-the-loop. I also collaborate with [Dr. Irene Li](https://ireneli.eu/) from [Li lab](https://www.li-lab.me/home), the University of Tokyo closely.

My research interest includes NLP, multi-modality, document AI and human-in-the-loop. I have published 20+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZzK_UdYAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FGeorgeLuImmortal%2FGeorgeLuImmortal.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI and NLP conferences such as NeurIPS, ACL, NAACL, AAAI, COLING.
